## My problems, bugs and cereals

1. Personal reminder : restart the cmd after installing something or just open it AFTER having installed the softwar...
2. How can I cut the executionDate data in 2 parts ?
3. I must do some part of code who can be apply with any datas wanted.
4. Do we have a special place to put the css file ? One for every component or one per component ?
5. I want a verification : if the structure correspond to the structure told in the mission then display it otherwise : null
6. I would like that '''<h1>Structures</h1>''' can correspond to titleText='Structure'
7. Why my .map doesn't work ?
8. My picture don't want to be dispalyed even with a width and a height defined


where to put this requierement ?

'''{ if(mission1.structures instanceof Array)titleText+='s';}


## Feelings

I don't know if I have to be happy for what I did or sad for what couldn't do... I still enjoyed my time learning a new language and fighting with bugs !
I wanted to do so many things like
  - Use .map to "automate" the cards displayed
  - Try different stats of a same element with StoryBook
  - Change a texte according the amount of datas in an array
  - write the number of datas in an array
  - Do more than the mission element


I tried not to ask for help to know what I can do by myself in a new language. I couldn't follow all the steps that I imposed me but still :
it's sure, I will continue to learn React and master in it one day !

Thanks a lot for this exercice !
